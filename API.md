# Deep Dive: API Design and Development for Lead Engineers

As a Lead Engineer, you're expected to not only build APIs but also to design them well, ensuring they are scalable, secure, maintainable, and easy to use. This section focuses on the key principles and best practices of API design and development, equipping you with the knowledge to lead API development efforts effectively.

## I. RESTful Principles: The Foundation of API Design

*   **Understanding REST Constraints:**

    *   **Uniform Interface:**
        *   **Definition:**  The interface between the client and server should be consistent and predictable, simplifying interaction.
        *   **Sub-Principles:**
            *   **Resource Identification:** Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
            *   **Resource Manipulation through Representations:** Clients manipulate resources by exchanging representations (e.g., JSON, XML) with the server. Operations on the resource are done via these representations.
            *   **Self-Descriptive Messages:** Messages should contain enough information to allow the client to process them (e.g., content type, links to related resources).
            *   **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):** The API should provide links to related resources and actions, allowing the client to navigate the API dynamically. (Not always practical, but the ideal).
        *   **Benefits:** Simplifies client development, promotes evolvability, and enables independent evolution of the client and server.
    *   **Stateless:**
        *   **Definition:** The server does not store any client state between requests. Each request from the client must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request.
        *   **Benefits:** Improves scalability, reliability, and visibility. Simplifies server-side logic, as there is no need to manage client sessions. Easier to debug and monitor..
    *   **Cacheable:**
        *   **Definition:** Responses should be explicitly marked as cachable or non-cachable. Clients and intermediaries (e.g., proxies, CDNs) can cache responses to improve performance and reduce server load.
        *   **Benefits:** Improves performance, reduces server load, and improves network efficiency.
    *   **Client-Server:**
        *   **Definition:** A separation of concerns between the client and the server. The client is responsible for the user interface and the user experience, while the server is responsible for data storage and processing.
        *   **Benefits:** Allows the client and server to evolve independently. Improves portability, scalability, and reusability.
    *   **Layered System:**
        *   **Definition:** The client should not need to know whether it is connecting directly to the end server or to an intermediary along the way. This allows for the introduction of intermediaries (e.g., proxies, load balancers) without affecting the client.
        *   **Benefits:** Improves scalability, security, and flexibility. Allows for the introduction of new features and functionalities without affecting the client.
    *   **Code on Demand (Optional):**
        *   **Definition:** The server can extend the functionality of the client by transferring executable code (e.g., JavaScript applets).
        *   **Benefits:** Improves client extensibility and reduces client complexity. (Less common in modern APIs)

*   **Example Lead Engineer Question:** "Explain the RESTful constraints and why they are important for API design. What is HATEOAS, and why is it considered the ideal REST interface (but often impractical)? How does statelessness contribute to API scalability? Explain each one, and what you should use?"

## II. API Design Best Practices

*   **Designing Clear, Consistent, and Well-Documented APIs:**

    *   **Resource Naming Conventions:**
        *   Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`).
        *   Use plural nouns for collections of resources (e.g., `/users` instead of `/user`).
        *   Use hierarchical URLs to represent relationships between resources (e.g., `/users/{user_id}/orders`).

    *   **HTTP Method Usage:**
        *   `GET`: Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources. Should be safe (does not modify data) and idempotent (multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request).
        *   `POST`: Create a new resource.
        *   `PUT`: Update an existing resource. Should replace the entire resource. Only updates the fields that are passed to the method
        *   `PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource. Should only modify the specified attributes.
        *   `DELETE`: Delete a resource.
    *   **Status Code Usage:**
        *   `200 OK`: Success.
        *   `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
        *   `204 No Content`: Request processed successfully, but there is no content to return.
        *   `400 Bad Request`: Client error (e.g., invalid input).
        *   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required.
        *   `403 Forbidden`: Not authorized to access the resource.
        *   `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error.
        *   `503 Service Unavailable`: The service is temporarily unavailable.
    *   **Request and Response Formats:**
        *   Use JSON as the primary data format.
        *   Provide clear and consistent data structures in request and response bodies.
        *   Support content negotiation to allow clients to request data in different formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
    *   **Error Handling:**
        *   Provide meaningful error messages in a consistent format. Including error codes, user-friendly messages, and debugging information.
        *   Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the type of error.
    *   **Pagination:**
        *   Implement pagination for endpoints that return large collections of resources.
        *   Use standard query parameters for pagination (e.g., `limit`, `offset`, `page`, `page_size`).
        *   Provide links to the next and previous pages in the response.
    *   **Filtering and Sorting:**
        *   Allow clients to filter and sort resources using query parameters.
        *   Use consistent naming conventions for filter and sort parameters.
    *   **API Documentation:**
        *   Use a tool like Swagger (OpenAPI) to automatically generate API documentation from your code.
        *   Provide clear and concise descriptions of all API endpoints, request and response formats, and error codes.
        *   Keep the documentation up-to-date with the latest API changes.
        *   When to use GRPC?
    *   **GraphQL vs Rest API** Explain what are the main advantages between each world
    *   **Idempotency** Explain what is idempotency and how can resolve it
    *   **Example Lead Engineer Question:** "Describe your approach to designing a RESTful API. What are the key considerations when naming resources and choosing HTTP methods? How do you handle error handling, pagination, and filtering in your APIs? What tools do you use for API documentation? How do you test the API to guarantee?"

## III. API Versioning: Managing Change and Compatibility

*   **Strategies for Managing API Changes:**

    *   **URI Versioning:**
        *   Include the API version in the URI (e.g., `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`).
        *   Simple to implement, but can lead to long URIs and may not be the most elegant solution.
    *   **Header Versioning:**
        *   Use a custom HTTP header to specify the API version (e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`).
        *   Cleaner URIs, but requires clients to explicitly set the header.
    *   **Content Negotiation:**
        *   Use the `Accept` header to specify the desired API version.
        *   Allows clients to request different versions of the API based on their capabilities.Requires careful design of media types.
    *   **Semantic Versioning**: Breaking number, features and patch.
*   **Deprecate** When an API is deprecated, provide a deadline.

*   **Best Practices:**

    *   Use a consistent versioning scheme across all APIs.
    *   Provide clear documentation of all API versions.
    *   Give clients sufficient time to migrate to newer API versions before deprecating older versions.
    *   Maintain backwards compatibility whenever possible.
    *   Use feature flags or A/B testing to gradually roll out new API features.
    *   Only remove the old version once you have enough metrics which support that.
    *   Before deprecating the API, send an email to who uses it.

*   **Example Lead Engineer Question:** "Explain different strategies for API versioning. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach? How do you ensure that existing clients are not broken when you make changes to an API? In practical terms, what would you use?"

## IV. API Security: Protecting Your APIs from Threats

*   **Authentication:**

    *   **Definition:** Verifying the identity of the client.
    *   **Mechanisms:**
        *   **API Keys:** A simple authentication mechanism that requires clients to include an API key in their requests.
        *   **HTTP Basic Authentication:** Sends the username and password in the HTTP header (Base64 encoded). Not secure and should only be used over HTTPS.
        *   **Session-Based Authentication:** Using cookies to track the user's session.
        *   **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are typically used for stateless authentication.
        *   **OAuth2:** A standard for delegating access to resources without sharing credentials.
        *   **Multi-Factor**: A layer on the authentication, generally done with a TOTP.

*   **Authorization:**

    *   **Definition:** Determining whether a client has permission to access a specific resource or perform a specific action.
    *   **Mechanisms:**
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigning roles to users and granting permissions to roles.
        *   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Granting permissions based on attributes of the user, the resource, and the environment.
*           **OWASP**: Implement OWASP validations in your code, like SQL Injection and others.

*   **Rate Limiting:**

    *   **Definition:** Restricting the number of requests that a client can make within a given time period.
    *   **Purpose:** Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Token Bucket Algorithm
        *   Leaky Bucket Algorithm
        *   Fixed Window Counters
        *   Sliding Window Log
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use a middleware component or an API gateway to implement rate limiting.
        *   Store rate limit information in a cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for fast access.
        *   Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when the rate limit is exceeded.

*   **Input Validation:**

    *   **Definition:** Validating all input data to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Use a schema validation library (e.g., Pydantic, Marshmallow) to define the expected format and data types of request parameters and request bodies.
        *   Sanitize input data to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
        *   Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    *   **Encryption:** Secure all the confidential values, and credentials. Make sure only the right components knows about it and can read it.
*   **Security Headers**: Add security headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` to protect against common web attacks like data hijacking and clickjacking.
*   **CORS :** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which domains are allowed to access your API. CORS is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
* **Secure Communication Channels (HTTPS):**
    *   Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and your API. This protects sensitive data such as authentication credentials and API keys from being intercepted by attackers.
*   **Example Lead Engineer Question:** "Explain different authentication and authorization mechanisms and when would you use each? What is the purpose of rate limiting, and how can you implement it? What are some common input validation techniques to prevent security vulnerabilities? How to implement mTLS?"

## V. API Gateways: The Entry Point to Your APIs

*   **Understanding API Gateway Concepts:**

    *   **Definition:** A reverse proxy that sits in front of one or more APIs and provides a single entry point for clients.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Centralized Authentication and Authorization:** Enforces security policies across all APIs.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implements rate limiting to protect APIs from abuse.
        *   **Request Routing:** Routes requests to the appropriate API based on the URL.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple instances of the API.
        *   **Request Transformation:** Transforms requests and responses to match the format expected by the client or the API.
        *   **Monitoring and Logging:** Provides centralized monitoring and logging of API traffic.
        *   **Version Control** You can control API version control for the backend and also expose with a friendly url the version controlled.

    *   **Common API Gateway Implementations:**
        *   **Kong**
        *   **Apigee**
        *   **AWS API Gateway**
        *   **Azure API Management**
        *   **Tyk**
*   **Why using a service mesh architecture and the benefits**
*   **Example Lead Engineer Question:** "What is an API gateway, and why is it useful? What are the key features of an API gateway? What factors would you consider when choosing an API gateway implementation? What's the limit of API Gateway?"

By mastering these API design and development principles, you'll be well-equipped to build scalable, secure, and maintainable APIs that meet the needs of your users and your organization. Be prepared to discuss real-world examples of how you've applied these concepts in your previous projects, demonstrating a practical understanding of API design best practices. And show how you can be up to date with the latest technologies like Envoy proxy.
