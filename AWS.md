────────────────────────────────────────
Overview and Basic Concept
────────────────────────────────────────
• AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code “without having to provision or manage servers.”
• You’re charged only for the compute time you consume (typically measured in increments of 100ms) making it cost-effective for many workloads.
• Functions automatically scale with request volume while remaining stateless.
• Ideal for event-driven architectures where code runs in response to events (such as file uploads, API calls, or scheduled events).

────────────────────────────────────────
Key Components & Terminology
────────────────────────────────────────
• Function: The individual piece of code you deploy on Lambda.
 Handler: The entry-point function that Lambda calls when your function is invoked.
  – Example: In Node.js, a typical handler might be processEvent.
• Package/Deployment: You bundle your code and any necessary dependencies (e.g., using a ZIP file or container image).
• Layers: Optional package that holds additional code or libraries that can be shared across multiple functions.
• IAM Execution Role:
  – Every function needs an associated role that grants it permission to call other AWS services (e.g., reading from S3 or writing to DynamoDB).
  – Follow the principle of least privilege for security.
• Configuration Options:
  – Memory: Allocate memory between 128 MB and 10,240 MB (scaling CPU automatically with memory).
  – Timeout: Maximum duration for function execution.
  – Environment Variables: For injecting configuration and secrets without hardcoding values.

────────────────────────────────────────
Supported Languages & Tools
────────────────────────────────────────
• Languages:
  – Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET Core, and even custom runtimes if needed.
• Integrated Tools:
  – AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for templating deployments.
  – CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code.
  – IDE integrations and the AWS CLI for deployment and management.
• CloudWatch Integration:
  – Automatic logging of stdout and stderr.
  – Metrics collection for monitoring performance.

────────────────────────────────────────
Event Sources & Triggers
────────────────────────────────────────
• Lambda functions are event-driven and can be triggered by a wide array of AWS services:
  – API Gateway: Invoke functions via HTTP endpoints (REST/GSOC).
  – S3: Trigger Lambda functions when objects are uploaded or modified.
  – CloudWatch Events / EventBridge: Schedule or react to time-based events.
  – DynamoDB Streams: Process changes to DynamoDB tables in real time.
  – Kinesis Streams: Process streaming data.
  – SNS: Respond to published messages (e.g., notifications or alerts).
  – Step Functions: Coordinate longer workflows by chaining functions.
• Note distinguishing between synchronous and asynchronous triggers:
  – Synchronous: Expect a direct response (common for API Gateway integration).
  – Asynchronous: AWS delivers the event irrespective of the function response (e.g., SNS events).

────────────────────────────────────────
Performance, Scaling & Limits
────────────────────────────────────────
• AWS Lambda automatically scales based on incoming requests – each concurrent request equals a new instance.
• Concurrency is key:
  – You can adjust reserved concurrency to limit maximum usage.
  – Be mindful of the “throttling” limits when spikes occur.
• Consider cold start latency:
  – Refresh your Lambda periodically because infrequently used functions take longer to start.
  – Choose languages and configurations that minimize startup time.
• Execution settings (timeout/memory) should be tuned based on your function use case.

────────────────────────────────────────
Deployment & Operational Best Practices
────────────────────────────────────────
• Packaging & Deployment:
  – Keep your deployment packages lightweight.
  – Use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies to reduce package size.
  – Consider continuous integration/continuous deployment workflows.
• Monitoring & Logging:
  – Use CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to monitor execution, error rates, and performance.
  – Integrate with AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing if your functions call downstream services.
• Security:
  – Use IAM roles with “least privilege” access.
  – Secure sensitive data via environment variables and AWS Secrets Manager.
• Versioning & Aliases:
  – Store multiple versions for testing vs. production.
  – Use aliases to point to specific versions in order to deploy canary releases.
• Testing:
  – Write unit tests for your function code.
  – Simulate real events in your test environment using mock triggers or local emulation.

────────────────────────────────────────
Use Cases
────────────────────────────────────────
• Image & Video Processing:
  – Trigger from S3 events when a file is uploaded and process it.
• Backend APIs:
  – Serve as backend services behind API Gateway.
• Data Transformation & ETL:
  – Transform or process streaming data (e.g., Kinesis or DynamoDB streams).
• Automation and Scheduled Tasks:
  – Run scheduled jobs in response to CloudWatch events or EventBridge.
• Web Applications:
  – Process events in real time and push notifications (via SNS).

Common questions for AWS lambda
────────────────────────────
What is AWS Lambda and how does it differ from a typical EC2-based architecture? 
──────────────────────────── 
• An ideal answer explains that AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for the computations performed. It emphasizes managed scaling and cost-effectiveness compared to an EC2 instance you need to provision, monitor, and scale manually.

────────────────────────────
2. How does AWS Lambda’s pricing work, and what are the main cost components?
────────────────────────────
• Describe that you pay per function invocation (with a minimum of 1 millisecond)/duration and mention that factors like execution time and allocated memory affect cost. Also touch on any network data transfer or integration costs if applicable.

────────────────────────────
3. Can you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous Lambda invocations?
────────────────────────────
• A good answer should differentiate that synchronous invocation expects an immediate response (often used with API Gateway), while asynchronous invocation (put requests for example via SNS, SQS, or Kinesis) does not require a response – the event is queued for later processing.

────────────────────────────
4. What is a “cold start” in AWS Lambda and how can you minimize its impact?
────────────────────────────
• Explain that a cold start occurs when a new instance of a function is initialized after being idle. You can mitigate its impact by keeping the functions warm (using scheduled events or auxiliary pings), reducing startup code, or choosing runtime languages known for faster boot times.

────────────────────────────
5. How does AWS Lambda automatically scale and what should you watch out for regarding concurrency limits?
────────────────────────────
• Describe how Lambda automatically spawns function instances as demand increases. Highlight potential pitfalls such as hitting service limits or encountering throttling when too many concurrent executions are requested. Mention reserved concurrency settings for more controlled scaling.

────────────────────────────
6. What are some common use cases for AWS Lambda?
────────────────────────────
• Include examples such as building serverless APIs with API Gateway, processing streaming or batch jobs (e.g., file processing from S3 events, DynamoDB Streams monitoring), or automating background tasks triggered by CloudWatch schedules.

────────────────────────────
7. How do AWS Lambda functions integrate with other AWS services?
────────────────────────────
• This question expects you to describe triggering functions via events from S3 (file uploads), API Gateway (HTTP APIs), CloudWatch events (scheduled tasks), and other integrations such as SNS/SQS. Give a practical example for context.

────────────────────────────
8. What role do AWS Lambda Layers play, and how can they improve your deployment?
────────────────────────────
• Explain that Layers allow you to package common libraries, custom runtime code, or other shared resources separately from your function package. This can simplify dependency management and reduce the size of your deployment package.

────────────────────────────
9. How do you handle error and retry logic in AWS Lambda, especially for asynchronous triggers?
────────────────────────────
• Describe using built-in retry mechanisms or custom error-handling strategies. Discuss how asynchronous invocations (via SQS, SNS) incorporate built-in retries and whether you implement idempotency or dead-letter queues (DLQs) if retries fail.

────────────────────────────
10. What configuration parameters are available when creating a Lambda function, and why are they important?
────────────────────────────
• This includes configurable memory allocation, execution timeout, environment variables, and concurrency limits. Discuss how these settings affect performance, cost, and resource efficiency.

────────────────────────────
11. How should environment variables be managed in AWS Lambda for sensitive data?
────────────────────────────
• Answer by recommending using secure storage (like AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager) for sensitive configuration, along with encryption and proper IAM permissions.

────────────────────────────
12. Explain the importance of IAM roles and policies for AWS Lambda.
────────────────────────────
• Describe that every Lambda function runs under an IAM role with specific permissions. Properly set the principle of least privilege to only allow required actions to those AWS services that your Lambda functions need to interact with.

────────────────────────────
13. How do you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize AWS Lambda functions after deployment?
────────────────────────────
• Discuss using Amazon CloudWatch for logs and metrics, AWS X-Ray for tracing requests through your functions, and tools like AWS CloudFormation or SAM to manage updates. Mention how to use the logs to diagnose issues.

────────────────────────────
14. Compare using AWS Lambda to traditional EC2 instances — under what circumstances would you choose one over the other?
────────────────────────────
• Emphasize that Lambda is ideal for short-lived, event-driven processing and when rapid scaling is critical, whereas EC2 allows more control over the environment. Highlight price differences, maintenance overhead, and operational complexity.

────────────────────────────
15. How do you manage versioning and deployment of Lambda functions?
────────────────────────────
• Describe using published versions, aliases, and rolling deployments. Talk about the benefits of versioning and aliasing, including testing, canary releases, or blue/green deployments.

────────────────────────────
16. What are some common pitfalls or limitations when using AWS Lambda?
────────────────────────────
• Mention constraints such as execution time limits (usually 15 minutes per function), deployment package size limits, cold start latency, and challenges with stateful processing. Also discuss potential issues with debugging given the ephemeral nature of serverless functions.

────────────────────────────
17. In a serverless architecture, what strategies can you employ to reduce cold start latency and improve performance?
────────────────────────────
• As mentioned earlier, you could use regular invocation (keep-warm events), minimize the function package size, use efficient programming languages, and employ provisioned concurrency if critical latency is required.

────────────────────────────
18. How would you use event sources (e.g., API Gateway, S3, SNS) to trigger a Lambda function and make it part of a larger workflow?
────────────────────────────
• Discuss real-world integration like triggering image processing after an upload to S3, user logins via API Gateway, or reacting to changes in a DynamoDB stream. Highlight how these events form part of a unified event-driven ecosystem.

────────────────────────────
19. What are the advantages of using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) or AWS CloudFormation for Lambda deployments?
────────────────────────────
• Explain that SAM and CloudFormation allow you to define your serverless infrastructure as code, which makes deployments repeatable, version-controllable, and easier to manage. SAM can simplify the definition of events, dependencies, and resources.

────────────────────────────
20. How do you optimize your Lambda deployment package and what impact does package size have on function cold starts?
────────────────────────────
• Discuss practices like trimming unnecessary dependencies, using layers for shared libraries, and keeping code modular. Emphasize that larger packages may increase cold start times and overall latency.

────────────────────────────
Bonus Question:
21. How would you design an end-to-end serverless workflow that uses Lambda along with S3, SQS, and API Gateway, including error handling and retries?
────────────────────────────
• Provide a blue-print describing how an upload to S3 can trigger a Lambda function for processing, how SQS can buffer failed messages for retry, and how API Gateway can expose REST endpoints. Also mention using DLQs to capture persistent failures.
