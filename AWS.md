# AWS Lambda: Notes & Common Interview Questions

## Overview and Basic Concept

* **AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that lets you run code **without having to provision or manage servers**.
* You’re charged only for the compute time you consume (typically measured in increments of 100ms), making it cost-effective for many workloads.
* Functions automatically scale with request volume while remaining stateless.
* Ideal for event-driven architectures where code runs in response to events (such as file uploads, API calls, or scheduled events).

## Key Components & Terminology

* **Function:** The individual piece of code you deploy on Lambda.
    * **Handler:** The entry-point function that Lambda calls when your function is invoked.
        * Example: In Node.js, a typical handler might be `processEvent`.
* **Package/Deployment:** You bundle your code and any necessary dependencies (e.g., using a ZIP file or container image).
* **Layers:** Optional package that holds additional code or libraries that can be shared across multiple functions.
* **IAM Execution Role:**
    * Every function needs an associated role that grants it permission to call other AWS services (e.g., reading from S3 or writing to DynamoDB).
    * Follow the principle of least privilege for security.
* **Configuration Options:**
    * **Memory:** Allocate memory between 128 MB and 10,240 MB (scaling CPU automatically with memory).
    * **Timeout:** Maximum duration for function execution.
    * **Environment Variables:** For injecting configuration and secrets without hardcoding values.

## Supported Languages & Tools

* **Languages:**
    * Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET Core, and even custom runtimes if needed.
* **Integrated Tools:**
    * **AWS SAM** (Serverless Application Model) for templating deployments.
    * **CloudFormation** for Infrastructure as Code.
    * IDE integrations and the AWS CLI for deployment and management.
* **CloudWatch Integration:**
    * Automatic logging of `stdout` and `stderr`.
    * Metrics collection for monitoring performance.

## Event Sources & Triggers

Lambda functions are event-driven and can be triggered by a wide array of AWS services:

* **API Gateway:** Invoke functions via HTTP endpoints (REST/GraphQL).
* **S3:** Trigger Lambda functions when objects are uploaded or modified.
* **CloudWatch Events / EventBridge:** Schedule or react to time-based events.
* **DynamoDB Streams:** Process changes to DynamoDB tables in real time.
* **Kinesis Streams:** Process streaming data.
* **SNS:** Respond to published messages (e.g., notifications or alerts).
* **Step Functions:** Coordinate longer workflows by chaining functions.
* **Note distinguishing between synchronous and asynchronous triggers:**
    * **Synchronous:** Expect a direct response (common for API Gateway integration).
    * **Asynchronous:** AWS delivers the event irrespective of the function response (e.g., SNS events).

## Performance, Scaling & Limits

* AWS Lambda automatically scales based on incoming requests – each concurrent request equals a new instance.
* **Concurrency is key:**
    * You can adjust reserved concurrency to limit maximum usage.
    * Be mindful of the “throttling” limits when spikes occur.
* **Consider cold start latency:**
    * Refresh your Lambda periodically because infrequently used functions take longer to start.
    * Choose languages and configurations that minimize startup time.
* Execution settings (timeout/memory) should be tuned based on your function use case.

## Deployment & Operational Best Practices

* **Packaging & Deployment:**
    * Keep your deployment packages lightweight.
    * Use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies to reduce package size.
    * Consider continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
* **Monitoring & Logging:**
    * Use CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to monitor execution, error rates, and performance.
    * Integrate with AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing if your functions call downstream services.
* **Security:**
    * Use IAM roles with “least privilege” access.
    * Secure sensitive data via environment variables and AWS Secrets Manager.
* **Versioning & Aliases:**
    * Store multiple versions for testing vs. production.
    * Use aliases to point to specific versions in order to deploy canary releases.
* **Testing:**
    * Write unit tests for your function code.
    * Simulate real events in your test environment using mock triggers or local emulation.

## Use Cases

* **Image & Video Processing:**
    * Trigger from S3 events when a file is uploaded and process it.
* **Backend APIs:**
    * Serve as backend services behind API Gateway.
* **Data Transformation & ETL:**
    * Transform or process streaming data (e.g., Kinesis or DynamoDB streams).
* **Automation and Scheduled Tasks:**
    * Run scheduled jobs in response to CloudWatch events or EventBridge.
* **Web Applications:**
    * Process events in real time and push notifications (via SNS).

## Key Takeaways

* AWS Lambda shifts the focus from server management to code logic—letting you concentrate on implementing features rather than infrastructure.
* Its integration with a wide range of AWS services creates a flexible, event-driven ecosystem.
* Always consider security, performance, and cost when designing your Lambda functions.

## Wrapping Up

* Brush up on the aspects mentioned above so you’re comfortable with event sources, configuration nuances, scaling limits, and the overall lifecycle of a Lambda function.
* Practice deploying a simple function using one of the languages you’re familiar with; test event triggers (like API Gateway or S3) to see the whole flow.
* Review AWS documentation and best practices periodically to incorporate any service improvements or new integrations.

## Common Interview Questions for AWS Lambda

1.  **What is AWS Lambda and how does it differ from a typical EC2-based architecture?**
    * An ideal answer explains that AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for the computations performed. It emphasizes managed scaling and cost-effectiveness compared to an EC2 instance you need to provision, monitor, and scale manually.

2.  **How does AWS Lambda’s pricing work, and what are the main cost components?**
    * Describe that you pay per function invocation (with a minimum of 1 millisecond)/duration and mention that factors like execution time and allocated memory affect cost. Also touch on any network data transfer or integration costs if applicable.

3.  **Can you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous Lambda invocations?**
    * A good answer should differentiate that synchronous invocation expects an immediate response (often used with API Gateway), while asynchronous invocation (put requests for example via SNS, SQS, or Kinesis) does not require a response – the event is queued for later processing.

4.  **What is a “cold start” in AWS Lambda and how can you minimize its impact?**
    * Explain that a cold start occurs when a new instance of a function is initialized after being idle. You can mitigate its impact by keeping the functions warm (using scheduled events or auxiliary pings), reducing startup code, or choosing runtime languages known for faster boot times.

5.  **How does AWS Lambda automatically scale and what should you watch out for regarding concurrency limits?**
    * Describe how Lambda automatically spawns function instances as demand increases. Highlight potential pitfalls such as hitting service limits or encountering throttling when too many concurrent executions are requested. Mention reserved concurrency settings for more controlled scaling.

6.  **What are some common use cases for AWS Lambda?**
    * Include examples such as building serverless APIs with API Gateway, processing streaming or batch jobs (e.g., file processing from S3 events, DynamoDB Streams monitoring), or automating background tasks triggered by CloudWatch schedules.

7.  **How do AWS Lambda functions integrate with other AWS services?**
    * This question expects you to describe triggering functions via events from S3 (file uploads), API Gateway (HTTP APIs), CloudWatch events (scheduled tasks), and other integrations such as SNS/SQS. Give a practical example for context.

8.  **What role do AWS Lambda Layers play, and how can they improve your deployment?**
    * Explain that Layers allow you to package common libraries, custom runtime code, or other shared resources separately from your function package. This can simplify dependency management and reduce the size of your deployment package.

9.  **How do you handle error and retry logic in AWS Lambda, especially for asynchronous triggers?**
    * Describe using built-in retry mechanisms or custom error-handling strategies. Discuss how asynchronous invocations (via SQS, SNS) incorporate built-in retries and whether you implement idempotency or dead-letter queues (DLQs) if retries fail.

10. **What configuration parameters are available when creating a Lambda function, and why are they important?**
    * This includes configurable memory allocation, execution timeout, environment variables, and concurrency limits. Discuss how these settings affect performance, cost, and resource efficiency.

11. **How should environment variables be managed in AWS Lambda for sensitive data?**
    * Answer by recommending using secure storage (like AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager) for sensitive configuration, along with encryption and proper IAM permissions.

12. **Explain the importance of IAM roles and policies for AWS Lambda.**
    * Describe that every Lambda function runs under an IAM role with specific permissions. Properly set the principle of least privilege to only allow required actions to those AWS services that your Lambda functions need to interact with.

13. **How do you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize AWS Lambda functions after deployment?**
    * Discuss using Amazon CloudWatch for logs and metrics, AWS X-Ray for tracing requests through your functions, and tools like AWS CloudFormation or SAM to manage updates. Mention how to use the logs to diagnose issues.

16. **What are some common pitfalls or limitations when using AWS Lambda?**
    * Mention constraints such as execution time limits (usually 15 minutes per function), deployment package size limits, cold start latency, and challenges with stateful processing. Also discuss potential issues with debugging given the ephemeral nature of serverless functions.

17. **In a serverless architecture, what strategies can you employ to reduce cold start latency and improve performance?**
    * As mentioned earlier, you could use regular invocation (keep-warm events), minimize the function package size, use efficient programming languages, and employ provisioned concurrency if critical latency is required.

18. **How would you use event sources (e.g., API Gateway, S3, SNS) to trigger a Lambda function and make it part of a larger workflow?**
    * Discuss real-world integration like triggering image processing after an upload to S3, user logins via API Gateway, or reacting to changes in a DynamoDB stream. Highlight how these events form part of a unified event-driven ecosystem.

19. **What are the advantages of using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) or AWS CloudFormation for Lambda deployments?**
    * Explain that SAM and CloudFormation allow you to define your serverless infrastructure as code, which makes deployments repeatable, version-controllable, and easier to manage. SAM can simplify the definition of events, dependencies, and resources.

20. **How do you optimize your Lambda deployment package and what impact does package size have on function cold starts?**
    * Discuss practices like trimming unnecessary dependencies, using layers for shared libraries, and keeping code modular. Emphasize that larger packages may increase cold start times and overall latency.

21. **Bonus Question: How would you design an end-to-end serverless workflow that uses Lambda along with S3, SQS, and API Gateway, including error handling and retries?**
    * Provide a blueprint describing how an upload to S3 can trigger a Lambda function for processing, how SQS can buffer failed messages for retry, and how API Gateway can expose REST endpoints. Also mention using DLQs to capture persistent failures.

## Overview and Basic Concept

* **AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is AWS’s core compute service that provides resizable **virtual servers** (known as **instances**) in the cloud.
* It offers on-demand access to compute resources, allowing you to scale up or down based on workload requirements.
* **Use Cases Include:**
    * Deploying web servers, application servers, and databases.
    * Running high-performance computing (HPC), big data analytics, or machine learning (ML) workloads.
    * Prototyping and hosting virtually any application environment.

---

## Instance Types and Pricing Models

### Instance Types

Choose from a variety of families based on the workload:

* **General Purpose:** Balanced CPU and memory (e.g., `t3`, `m5`). Great for typical web servers and dev/test environments.
* **Compute Optimized:** High CPU performance (e.g., `c5`). Ideal for compute-intensive applications, batch processing, and high-performance web servers.
* **Memory Optimized:** Heavy memory workloads (e.g., `r5`). Suited for high-performance databases, distributed web-scale in-memory caches, and real-time big data analytics.
* **Accelerated Computing (GPU Instances):** Designed for graphics-intensive and deep learning tasks (e.g., `p3`, `g4dn`).
* **Storage Optimized:** High sequential read/write access to large datasets on local storage (e.g., `i3`, `d2`). Good for NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and distributed file systems.

### Pricing Models

* **On-Demand Instances:** Pay by the hour (or second for Linux) with zero long-term commitments. Ideal for unpredictable workloads, development/test environments, or applications with short-term, spiky usage.
* **Reserved Instances (RIs):** Significant discounts (up to 72%) for committing to a 1-year or 3-year term.
    * **Standard RIs:** Highest discount, but inflexible for instance type/OS changes.
    * **Convertible RIs:** Slightly less discount but allow changes to instance family, OS, and tenancy.
    * **Scheduled RIs:** Reserve capacity for specific recurring time windows.
* **Spot Instances:** Bid for spare EC2 capacity at significantly lower prices (up to 90% off On-Demand).
    * **Volatile:** Instances can be terminated by AWS with a two-minute warning if the Spot price exceeds your bid or if capacity is no longer available.
    * Suitable for fault-tolerant, flexible applications like batch processing, data analysis, and stateless web servers.
* **Dedicated Instances/Hosts:** Run on isolated physical servers for licensing requirements (e.g., bring-your-own-license scenarios) or strict regulatory compliance.
    * **Dedicated Instances:** Your instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level.
    * **Dedicated Hosts:** Gives you visibility and control over the specific physical server where your instances run.

---

## Key Components & Launch Process

* **AMIs (Amazon Machine Images):** Pre-configured templates that contain the operating system, software, and other configurations needed to launch an instance. You can use AWS-provided AMIs, AWS Marketplace AMIs, or create your own custom AMIs.
* **Key Pair for SSH:** A set of cryptographic keys (public and private) used to establish secure remote access to Linux instances (via SSH) or to decrypt the administrator password for Windows instances (for RDP). You hold the private key, AWS stores the public key.

### Launching an Instance Typically Involves:

* Selecting the desired **AMI**.
* Choosing an **instance type** that suits your compute, memory, or storage requirements.
* Configuring **network settings**, including selecting a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets (public/private), and assigning **security groups**.
* Attaching **storage** (EBS volumes for persistent storage, or ephemeral instance store volumes).
* Configuring advanced options like IAM roles, user data scripts (for initial setup), and monitoring.
* Reviewing pricing details and potential cost savings with reservations.
* Launching via the **AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools** (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform).

---

## Networking & Security

* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
    * Provides isolated networking environments within AWS with defined subnets, IP address ranges, and routing tables.
    * You customize configurations for public (internet-facing) and private (internal) resources.
    * Essential for organizing your network logically and securely.
* **Security Groups:**
    * Act as **virtual firewalls** to control inbound and outbound network traffic at the instance level.
    * They are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic, the outbound response is automatically allowed.
    * Crucial for ensuring that only necessary ports and protocols are are accessible as per your application’s requirements (e.g., Port 22 for SSH, Port 80/443 for HTTP/S).
* **Network Access Control Lists (Network ACLs):**
    * Optional, stateless firewalls that control traffic at the subnet level.
    * Less granular than security groups, but can add an additional layer of security.
* **IAM Roles & Instance Profiles:**
    * Grant permissions to your instances securely **without using static credentials** (like API keys directly on the instance).
    * Use IAM roles to allow your EC2 instances to securely interact with other AWS services (e.g., read from S3, write to DynamoDB, send logs to CloudWatch).
    * An **instance profile** is a container for an IAM role that you can attach to an EC2 instance.

---

## Storage Options

* **Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volumes:**
    * Provides durable, **block-level storage** that can be attached to an EC2 instance.
    * Persists independently of the instance's lifespan (i.e., data remains even if the instance is stopped or terminated).
    * Can be backed up using **EBS Snapshots** to S3.
    * Available in several volume types:
        * **SSD-backed:** General Purpose SSD (`gp2`/`gp3` - balanced price/performance), Provisioned IOPS SSD (`io1`/`io2` - highest performance for critical workloads).
        * **HDD-backed:** Throughput Optimized HDD (`st1` - good for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads), Cold HDD (`sc1` - lowest cost for less frequently accessed data).
* **Instance Stores:**
    * Offer **temporary block storage** directly attached to the host computer that houses the EC2 instance.
    * Provide very high I/O performance.
    * **Ephemeral:** Data is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or if there’s an underlying hardware failure. Not suitable for persistent data.
* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
    * While not directly attached like EBS or Instance Store, S3 is **object storage** often used with EC2 for static assets, backups, data lakes, or as a source/destination for applications running on EC2.
* **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):**
    * A **scalable, shared file system** that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously (even across Availability Zones). Ideal for workloads that require shared file access (e.g., content management systems, dev environments).

---

## Monitoring & Management

* **Amazon CloudWatch:**
    * The primary monitoring and observability service for AWS resources.
    * Monitor system performance metrics for EC2 instances like **CPU utilization, disk I/O, network usage, and instance status checks**.
    * Set up **alarms** to trigger notifications (e.g., via SNS) or automated responses (e.g., stopping an instance) when thresholds are breached.
    * Collects **logs** from your EC2 instances (with the CloudWatch Agent).
* **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG):**
    * Automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand.
    * Ensures **high availability** (by replacing unhealthy instances) and **cost efficiency** (by scaling out during peak times and scaling in during low usage).
    * Works seamlessly with **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)** to evenly distribute incoming traffic across healthy instances in the ASG.
* **AWS Systems Manager:**
    * Offers comprehensive management and automation capabilities for operating your instances, both EC2 and on-premises.
    * Features include: **Patch Manager** (for OS updates), **Run Command** (for remote execution of scripts), **Session Manager** (secure shell access without opening SSH ports), and **State Manager** (for configuring instance state).

---

## Best Practices

* **Select the Right Instance Type:**
    * Analyze workload patterns (CPU, memory, storage, network requirements) to optimize for compute, memory, or GPU requirements.
    * Start small and scale up (or out) as needed. Resize or deploy multiple instances (with ASGs) as suited by performance and cost considerations.
* **Minimize Idle Resources:**
    * Implement strategies to stop or terminate instances that are not in use (e.g., during off-hours for dev environments) to avoid unnecessary charges.
    * Leverage Auto Scaling and Load Balancers to manage instance count dynamically and align with actual demand.
* **Secure with Best Practices:**
    * Use the **principle of least privilege** when assigning IAM roles to instances.
    * Regularly review and update Security Group rules to follow "deny all by default" and only open necessary ports to trusted IP ranges.
    * Disable public IP addresses for instances that don't need direct internet access; route through NAT Gateways for outbound access from private subnets.
    * Leverage **AWS Trusted Advisor** for recommendations on cost optimization, security, and performance.
* **Clean Up and Documentation:**
    * Maintain **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** templates (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform) to standardize instance provisioning and ensure consistency.
    * Regularly review and clean up unused instances, AMIs, snapshots, and EBS volumes to reduce clutter and recurring costs.
    * Implement **tagging strategies** for better resource organization, cost allocation, and automation.
